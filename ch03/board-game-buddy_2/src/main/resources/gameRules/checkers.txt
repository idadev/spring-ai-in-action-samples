Win the battle by being the first player to collect all of your Burger's ingredients.

== SET UP

STEP 1: Shuffle the 8 large Burger cards and deal one to each player. Each player will leave their Burger face up in front of them.
STEP 2: Shuffle the deck thoroughly and deal 5cards to each player. Each player will hold their 5 cards where only they can see them.
STEP 3: Place the remaining deck face down in the center of the table. Flip the top card over to the side; this will act as the Graveyard.
STEP 4: Should the game continue once the deck is depleted, take the Graveyard, reshuffle and repeat step 3.

== YOUR CARDS

There are two types of pieces in Checkers: regular pieces and kings. Regular pieces can only move forward diagonally, while kings can move both forward and backward diagonally.
The number of pieces each player starts with depends on the size of the board. On an 8x8 board, each player starts with 14 pieces placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.
So, there are a total of 28 pieces on the board at the start of the game.
